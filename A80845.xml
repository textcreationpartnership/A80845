         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When ſin is at the higheſt and moſt daringly prophane; Saints deſpiſed and diſpondent, deeming that God <hi>hath forſaken the earth, and will not regard the ſons of men,</hi> or requite the wickedneſſe of the wicked but leave them at liberty to blaſpheme his name, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his people, then the Lord is neareſt hand, his holineſſe &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice moſt likely to appear; Thus it was in the old world, in <hi>Sodoms</hi> ruine, &amp; <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> captivity, and thus it muſt be, to</p>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:170496:151"/> any fixed friendly ſociety thus to do; is (in my eye) without the leaſt of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: for they want not only the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall, but parentall and magiſterial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; which ſhould award ſuch a kind of inſtruction; I do believe the propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call priveledge of a believer is preſcribed and limited to thoſe whom nature hath put in ſubjection to him; and will not, nay, muſt not be extended to his Peeres &amp; brethren: moreover they, in ſo doing, deſtroy the duty to which they pretend, for their work ſhould be to <hi>conferre by colloquy,</hi> to communicate each to other: their buſineſſe is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">4. Prudence muſt direct us <hi>unto order in our conference</hi> as wel as care in reſpect of time, place and manner: confuſion is incident to, and muſt be carefully ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by all ſociety: when the godly meet to conferre, they muſt be orderly in <hi>the matter</hi> of their conference, laying the foundation before they rear the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure; acquainting themſelves with Rudiments and principles; before they enquire into higher matters of faith: there are many things in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which men whilſt weak in, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of principles are not able to bear: firſt conferre of matters eſſentiall to ſaith, and then go forward: debate the duties, before the dignities of a believer; the high flown Saints of our age can conferre of nothing but their priviledges and high enjoyments of God, Chriſt and the ſpirit: and ſo nouriſh pride and fancy; but not faith: and as you muſt be orderly in the matter, debating what

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:170496:152"/> of holy conference: which hath fallen within my own time and knowledge, which proved the prologue of apoſtacy from the Church and Covenant of God unto the men that uſed it: In <hi>Audly</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> lived many eminent profeſſors of Religion with whom I have had ſweet Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and taken ſweet counſell many times; many of them were men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts unto prayer and conference, in which they were very converſant: in proceſſe of time, they fell under a very weak &amp; dul miniſtrie; which gave them occaſion to be more frequent in their conference each with other; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the Lords day; pretending by themſelvs to make up the defects of the miniſtry which was over them; untill at length they fixed their conference <hi>on one day</hi> in the week, and ſometimes <hi>on the Lords day</hi> to be held in the <hi>publick place or Church</hi> and did cal unto it by the tolling of the bell; &amp; one of them more apt then the reſt, ſpake unto the reſt, of which miſcarriage in a private duty I
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:170496:153"/> had (by ſome more humble then the reſt) notice given me &amp; came to the men and blamed their indiſcretion, who in the ſinfulneſſe of pride, ſcorned my inſtruction and would not be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; another grave and reverend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, (whom they had much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) dealt with them on the ſame account but all in vain; for in this courſe they continued untill they brake out into the contempt of the miniſtry; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from the Church; and caſting off the Covenant of their baptiſme; and conſtituted themſelves a Church; unto which, the men of beſt parts but moſt proud, are at this day become lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and profeſſed Miniſters; be wiſe in time for it is ſad to ſee how by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of piety Gods ordinances are ſlighted and ſouls ſeemingly Godly are ſeduced from the truth. Thus much for the 2. direction.</p>
               <p>The 3. and laſt direction is this, <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe a ſuitable frame of ſpirit unto the due management of holy conference:</hi> It is
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:170496:153"/> the duty of every Saint, but ſuch as are moſt converſant therein, and will ſtudy to make it edifying, and enforce it to its end, muſt be fitted thereunto, by theſe eſpecial qualifications which muſt be poſſeſſed. <hi>viz.</hi> the</p>

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:170496:154"/> and conſtitutions; actions and abilities of their brethren; who will ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to a wearied ſoul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Sincere deſire to edifie and be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> to propagate grace and godlineſs not to proclaim parts and proudly act abilities: if conference be <hi>Pauls</hi> Errand to <hi>Rome,</hi> his onely end is to impart ſome ſpeciall gift that the Saints may be eſtabliſhed; and he be comforted by the mutuall faith of one another: the weakeſt member of the body is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its place: every joynt makes its proper ſupply unto the increaſe of the whole body.</p>
